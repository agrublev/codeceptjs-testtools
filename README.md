# Codeception TestTools

This is a CodeceptJS modification based on the original Laravel TestTools Chrome extension by Marcel Pociot

Check out the [introduction post](http://marcelpociot.com/blog/2016-03-21-laravel-testtools) about the original Chrome extension.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:synaq/codeceptjs-testtools.git

# in case you don't have Grunt yet:
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Build instructions

```
cd codeception-testtools
npm install
grunt
```

When the grunt command is finished, you can use the `build/unpacked-dev/` folder to use as the developer version of the extension.
